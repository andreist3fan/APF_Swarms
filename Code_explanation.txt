main.py: 
Set the parameters of the setup and run the simulation 
Creates the environment and agents based on Setup and also runs the evaluation 

mc_main_scattering.py: 
Monte Carlo Simulation for analysiing effect of scattering 

mc_main_swarm size.py: 
Monte Carlo Simulation for analysiing effect of swarm size 

Setup.py: 
Class for all the meta variables for the simulation 
If you want to change the value of a parameter (e.g. use a different algorithm), please change that in the main functions
in an object of the class and not in the class itself (the Setup file)

Agent.py: 
Class for agents that uses the files in the agent_algorithms folder 

Agent_algorithms: 
Folder that includes a file for each algorithm (we could also include these functions in the Agent class but it 
might be easier like this for testing purposes)

Environment.py: 
Class for Enviornment 

Evaluation.py: 
Class for Evaluation 

Hyperparameter_tuner.py: 
Code used to find correct hyperparameters for algorithms
