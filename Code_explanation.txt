main.py: 
Set the parameters of the setup and run the simulation 
Creates the environment and agents based on Setup and also runs the evaluation 

Setup.py: 
Class for all the meta variables for the simulation 

Agent.py: 
Class for agents that uses the files in the agent_algorithms folder 

Agent_algorithms: 
Folder that includes a file for each algorithm (we could also include these functions in the Agent class but it 
might be easier like this for testing purposes)

Environment: 
Class for Enviornment 

Evaluation: 
Class for Evaluation
